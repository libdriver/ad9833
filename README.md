## LibDriver AD9833

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/ad9833/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The AD9833 is a low power, programmable waveform generator capable of producing sine, triangular, and square wave outputs. Waveform generation is required in various types of sensing, actuation, and time domain reflectometry (TDR) applications. The output frequency and phase are software programmable, allowing easy tuning. No external components are needed. The frequency registers are 28 bits wide: with a 25 MHz clock rate, resolution of 0.1 Hz can be achieved; with a 1 MHz clock rate, the AD9833 can be tuned to 0.004 Hz resolution. The AD9833 is written to via a 3-wire serial interface. This serial interface operates at clock rates up to 40 MHz and is compatible with DSP and microcontroller standards. The device operates with a power supply from 2.3 V to 5.5 V. The AD9833 has a power-down function (SLEEP). This function allows sections of the device that are not being used to be powered down, thus minimizing the current consumption of the part. For example, the DAC can be powered down when a clock output is being generated.

LibDriver AD9833 is a full-featured driver of AD9833 launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of direct digital frequency synthesis(DDS) output and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SPI platform independent template and finish your platform SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_ad9833_basic.h"

uint8_t res;

/* init */
res = ad9833_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* set number */
res = ad9833_basic_set_used_register(AD9833_NUMBER_0);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)ad9833_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

/* set freq */
res = ad9833_basic_set_frequency(AD9833_NUMBER_0, 10 * 1000);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)ad9833_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* set phase */
res = ad9833_basic_set_phase(number, 3.14159265357 / 2);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)ad9833_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* set output mode */
res = ad9833_basic_set_output_mode(AD9833_OUTPUT_MODE_SIN);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)ad9833_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...

/* deinit */
(void)ad9833_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
